			<h2> History </h2>
			<h3> Mesoamerican History </h3>
				<p>
					The preparation of chocolate started in Mesoamerica (central and Southern America) where the cacao tree is native to. 
					One of the earliest uses of cacao was identified in South America, in the Amazon region around 5,300 years ago. 
					They identified it using cacao starch grains, absorbed theobromine residues, and ancient DNA. 
					Another detection of chocolate was found in Guatemala, where archeologists discovered a vessel covered with glyphs that translated to cacao and that had traces of theobromine in it. 
					This was dated to 460-480 AD.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Mayans from Guatemala had writings about cacao that relate a chocolate drink to the gods. 
					They made this drink by mixing roasted cacao seed paste, water, chile peppers, and cornmeal. 
					They mixed it until there was a thick foam resting on the top of the liquid. 
					It was used in many different types of ceremonies and used for medicinal purposes.
				</p>
					In 1400, the Aztecs took over a large area of Mesoamerica. 
					The cacao bean became a form of currency and was given as tribute to the Aztecs. 
					They associated cacao with the god Quetzalcoatl who they believed shared the chocolate with them. 
					The chocolate drink was used for celebrations and were part of the rations of the common soldier.

			<h3> European History </h3>
				<p>
					Chocolate only became known to Europeans in the 16th century. 
					Europeans&rsquo; first encounter with it might have been when Christopher Columbus came to the Americas for the fourth time and when he seized a canoe with many trade items in it and took it back to Europe. 
					Another encounter was when the conquistador, Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, came to conquer Mexico. 
					After Spain conquered the Aztecs, the chocolate and cacao beans were imported to Europe where it was originally used for medicinal purposes. 
					They then tried to sweeten it and it became very popular as a court beverage.
				</p>
				<p>
					The desire for chocolate unfortunately created a prosperous slave market as the process of making chocolate was still manual and was a very labourious task. 
					In 1729, the first cocoa grinder was created and then patented. 
					It used a water engine and was the first step towards the automation of chocolate production. 
					Throughout the Industrial Revolution, the production of chocolate was improved and refined with automation. 
					In 1845, solid chocolate was invented and the process was bought by the Lindt Factory.
