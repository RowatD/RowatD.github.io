			<h2> History </h2>
			<h3> Mesoamerican History </h3>
			
			<p>
				The preparation of chocolate started in Mesoamerica (central and Southern America) where the cacao tree is native to. 
				One of the earliest uses of cacao was identified in South America, in the Amazon region around 5,300 years ago. 
				They identified it using cacao starch grains,
				absorbed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carmendrahl/2017/02/14/theobromine-chocolate-chemistry-valentines/?sh=47743b0d59fc">theobromine </a> residues, and ancient DNA. 
				Another detection of chocolate was found in Guatemala, where archeologists discovered a vessel covered with glyphs that translated to cacao and that had traces of theobromine in it. 
				This was dated to 460-480 AD.

			<p>
				The Mayans from Guatemala had writings about cacao that relate a chocolate drink to the gods. 
				They made this drink by mixing roasted cacao seed paste, water, chile peppers, and cornmeal. 
				They mixed it until there was a thick foam resting on the top of the liquid. 
				It was used in many different types of ceremonies and used for medicinal purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1400, the Aztecs took over a large area of Mesoamerica. 
				The cacao bean became a form of currency and was given as tribute to the Aztecs. 
				They associated cacao with the god Quetzalcoatl who they believed shared the chocolate with them. 
				The chocolate drink was used for celebrations and were part of the rations of the common soldier.
			</p>
			<h3> European History </h3>
			
			<p>
				Chocolate only became known to Europeans in the 16th century. 
				Europeans&rsquo; first encounter with it might have been when Christopher Columbus came to the Americas for the fourth time and when he seized a canoe with many trade items in it and took it back to Europe. 
				Another encounter was when the conquistador, Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, came to conquer Mexico. 
				After Spain conquered the Aztecs, the chocolate and cacao beans were imported to Europe where it was originally used for medicinal purposes. 
				They then tried to sweeten it and it became very popular as a court beverage.

			<p>
				The desire for chocolate unfortunately created a prosperous slave market as the process of making chocolate was still manual and was a very labourious task. 
				In 1729, the first cocoa grinder was created and then patented. 
				It used a water engine and was the first step towards the automation of chocolate production. 
				Throughout the Industrial Revolution, the production of chocolate was improved and refined with automation. 
				In 1845, solid chocolate was invented and the process was bought by the Lindt Factory.

			<h2> Types of Chocolate </h2>
			<h3> Raw Chocolate </h3>
			<p>
				Usually, chocolate is made using a very complicated process.
				Cacao beans are picked, fermented, roasted, ground down, pressed, mixed with fat and sugar, and then turned into different sweets (here is a more detailed page on <a class="other-page" href="chocolateinstruction.html">how to make chocolate</a>).
				Raw chocolate is made slightly differently, you just don&rsquo;t roast the beans.
				The manufacturers of raw chocolate claim that not roasting the beans allows minerals and nutrients to be preserved, such as iron, zinc, magnesium, copper, and vitamin C.
				It&rsquo;s also claimed that raw chocolate has higher levels of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidants-explained">antioxidants</a>. </p>

			<p>
				There seems to be many health benefits to raw chocolate, but professor of biochemistry at Heriot-Watt University, Martin Schweizer, says
				&ldquo;We have to look at this in more depth, including the level of components in each. The research is at a fairly early stage.&rdquo;
				People are worried that not roasting the beans will result in an increase of bacteria but the producers say that it should not be a concern.
				Raw chocolate is also said to have a more natural taste than chocolate using roasted beans.
			</p>
			<h3> Dark Chocolate </h3>
			
			<p>
				Compared to milk chocolate that contains 10-50&percnt; cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and sugar, dark chocolate contains 50-90&percnt; cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and sugar.
				Dark chocolate usually doesn&rsquo;t contain any milk, but since a lot of companies use the same machines for both dark and milk chocolate, there is sometimes cross contamination.
				Lower quality dark chocolate sometimes has butter fat, vegetable oil, or artificial colours or flavours.

			<!--My friend says "dark chocolate is like totally epic"-->
			<p>
				Dark chocolate has a lot of health benefits as it contains more cocoa solids than other chocolates. Cocoa has plant chemicals called flavonals.
				These chemicals can help to produce nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels and improves blood flow.
				Even with all these health benefits, eating dark chocolate too much is bad for you, as it contains saturated fat and can contribute to weight gain.
			</p>
			<h3> Milk Chocolate </h3>
			
			<p>
				Milk chocolate was created by swiss chocolatier, Daniel Peter.
				He combined cocoa mass, cocoa butter, and sugar with condensed milk and milk chocolate was born. 
				Since then, many countries have produced their own versions of milk chocolate, for example, Belgian chocolate is known for a mild milky taste and
				Russian chocolate is known to have a stronger cocoa taste.
				In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20&percnt; cocoa solids while in the rest of europe the minimum is 25&percnt; cocoa solids.

			<p>
				There are health benefits to milk chocolate too.
				<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146309">MRI</a> scans have shown that chocolate consumption can reduce the risk of heart disease.
				There is caffeine in chocolate as well and it is said to stimulate the nervous system,
				although some see this as a health concern.
			</p>
			<p>
				When making milk chocolate, after creating the cocoa butter and cocoa mass, we add the milk product.
				Many people prefer to use powdered milk, usually spray dried full fat milk powder but sometimes people use skimmed milk powder.
				Condensed milk can also be used especially in seasonal milk chocolate, and rice milk can be substituted to make lactose free milk chocolate.
			</p>
			<h3> White Chocolate </h3>
			
			<p>
				Usually, chocolate is made from the cocoa solids and cocoa butter of cocoa liquor, but white chocolate is only made with the cocoa butter, which is the fat from the cacao bean.
				This means that white chocolate technically isn&rsquo;t a chocolate at all.
				It is made from cocoa butter, sugar, milk solids, and occasionally vanilla.

			<p>
				White chocolate was created in 1936 by Nestl&eacute; and was adopted by many other companies soon after.
				From 1948 until the 1990s, Nestl&eacute; sold a white chocolate bar with almonds in it.
				Also in the 1990s, hershey started selling and producing white Kisses and then later produced swirled white and dark chocolate Hugs.
