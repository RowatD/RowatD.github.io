			<p id="starting-words"> There are many steps that go into chocolate making. Here is a list of the steps </p>
			<h2> Harvesting From the Cacao Tree </h2>
			
			<p>
				Cacao beans come from the cacao tree. These are used to make chocolate.
				The cacao tree is a delicate tree that needs proper care and nourishment.
				They yield fruit after 3 or 4 years and there are four main types of fruit.

			<ul>
				<li>
					Criollo: A very high quality bean grown in Central America and the Caribbean.
					The pod is soft, thin, and light coloured. It is very rare and has a low yield.
				</li>
				<li>
					Forastero: This bean is more common but is easier to produce. These beans are thicker and have a stronger taste.
					It is grown in Brazil and Africa.
				</li>
				<li>
					Trinitario: This is a cross between forastero and criollo. It originated in Trinidad and is a good quality bean.
				</li>
				<li>
					Nacional: This bean is prone to disease and very difficult to grow, but it has a nice aroma.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The cultivated trees grow to be 15-25 feet tall although wild trees can grow up to 60 feet. Because of their height, they can be very difficult to harvest from.
				To harvest the beans from the pods, people either use machetes or hit the pod against a rock.
				They then take out the white beans and transport them. One worker can harvest 1500 pods a day.
			</p>
			<h2> Fermenting the Beans </h2>
			
			<p>
				The main reason the beans are fermented is to eliminate or reduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astringent"> astringency</a> and to more fully develop the cacao flavor.
				Without the fermentation process, the chocolate wouldn't taste like chocolate. Although some people make chocolate without fermenting the beans for traditional dishes.
				It can take two to eight days to ferment the cacao beans depending on the type of bean. Whether it's criollo, forastero, trinitario, or nacional.
				Cacao beans have a white mucilage coating them. This coating falls off of the beans during fermentation and can be used for wines, alcohol, marmalade, jam and syrup.

			<p> Anaerobic Phase </p>
			<p>
				This is the first 48 hours of fermentation. During this time, the sugar and yeast in the pulp of the beans turns into alcohol and carbon dioxide.
			</p>
			<p> Aerobic Phase</p>
			<p>
				After 48 hours, the aerobic phase begins. The beans are turned and aeration allows growth of Acetobacter, which then turns the alcohol into acetic acid.
				The temperatures are raised to about 50&deg; Celcius and because of the heat, the bud of the bean dies.
				When the bud dies, chemical changes happen to make the chocolate taste.
				To help with the fermentation, banana leaves are placed on top of the beans as they have natural yeast and organisms.
			</p>
			<h2> Drying </h2>
			<p>
				After fermenting the beans, they are then sun-dried which takes about 1-2 weeks and their colour changes from reddish brown to dark brown.
			</p>
			<h2> Roasting </h2>
			
			<p>
				Roasting is useful because it will kill bacteria and any organisms, separate the outer husk from the inner bean, and allows for more chemical changes to happen.
				There are many roasting processes.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> Pre-roasting </li>
				<p>
					The cocoa beans are heated with infa-red heaters and hot air at 100-200&deg; Celcius for 20-30 minutes.
					This separates the shells from the bean meat (or nibs).
				</p>
				<li> Direct roasting (without pre-roasting) </li>
				<p>
					If you don't pre-roast, you can directly roast by heating the beans with their shells and then taking off the shells after.
					This is a more traditional method and lets the chocolate flavor develop better.
					In this method, the beans are roasted at 150-160&deg; Celcius for 40-50 minutes.
				</p>
			</ul>
			<h2> Winnowing </h2>
			<p>
				After roasting the beans, they are &ldquo;winnowed&rdquo; to remove the shells from the beans.
				This process is done by machines and the only thing left are the nibs of the chocolate.
				These are pure cocoa pieces.
			</p>
			<h2> Grinding of Nibs </h2>
			<p>
				In this step, the cocoa nibs are ground down into chocolate liquor. This contains both cocoa solids and cocoa butter. 
				There are over 300 different chemical compounds in this product. Cocoa butter has no flavor or aroma, but it is what gives chocolate it&rsquo;s smoothness.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this entire process, sugar, milk, and other ingredients are added and other processes happen to make certain kinds of chocolate.
				Dark chocolate is made using sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor. Milk chocolate is made using sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla.
				White chocolate is made using sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla.
